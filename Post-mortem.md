# Approach and Process
## What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
- Spent too long figuring out what sprite to use.

## What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
- I enjoyed making a game, and it would encourage me to continue working on it afterwards.

## Code and Code Design
### What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
- Structuring the code is hard, understanding other people's game code is hard, so I should've done those earlier. Understanding my own code was difficult too.
- Creating each thing every time instead of reusing

### What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time? For each, please include code examples.
- Flapping, rocks falling was fun, collision detection
- Writing the reusable objects in a class and understanding classes and methods


# SEI Unit 4 Post Mortem
## What habits did I use during SEI that helped me, that I will take on to my future coding projects?
- Writing each part separately and practising things in modules before combining them all

## What habits did I have during SEI I can improve on that I will try to change on future projects?
- Working more consistently

## How is the overall level of the course overall? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
