The game that both inspires me and represent me is persona 4, The protagonist is a blank slate. No note worthy qualities or special skills initially, even a bit isolated. But through awakening his own potential and improving himself he becomes the most powerful being there is. Able to overcome any challenge as he uses the personas he acquired over his struggle for the truth. The story also relies on bonds as well, formed between the protagonist and characters. I am a very apathetic person who puts no effort into what I do, including forming bonds with those around me. But after playing this game I realized how important bonds with others actually are, how they can save you. I came to admire the fools journey and how every story must start from a fresh beginning and no matter what can be overcome. I took it as an inspiration to be who I am and to face and accept myself despite my own shortcomings

# SWAN!

- start with the swan eating vegetation in a pond, then start game to fly to migrate
- loading page is random swan facts

- They will graze big grassy fields, and can survive quite successfully in a field of short-cropped grass.


## fun facts
- Swans can sleep on either land or the water. They have the option of sleeping while standing on one leg or while floating in the water.

- All of the mute swans in England and Wales are owned by the Queen of England.

- Despite popular belief, swans can actually fly. They are among the largest flying birds out there and need about 30 yards to become airborne.

- Black swans are native to Australia and New Zealand. They are not typically found in North America, but due to them being bred and sold for private lakes, it is possible.

- Although it is true that swans are gentle and defensive animals by nature, they have their rare moments of aggression. If any intruder (such as another swan, geese, or even a human) gets too close to their nesting ground or young, they may chase them away.

- They may also bite – not in the typical sense considering they have no teeth, but they can still pinch the skin which can be irritable.

- It is best to steer clear of pestering swans, however, because children have received broken arms from getting too close!
